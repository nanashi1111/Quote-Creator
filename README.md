- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
- [Photo Editor](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor) - A Photo Editor library with simple, easy support for image editing using Paints, Text, Filters, Emoji and Sticker like stories.
- [Square Camera](https://github.com/boxme/SquareCamera) - Android module that takes a square photo using the native Android Camera APIs. The new Camera2 APIs from the L release is not used because support has to go back to SDK version 14 for my own requirement.
